. In the Hello world program, make your class public and execute the program. Then change the name of the class (without changing the file name). What happens?
I changed my public class name without canging the filename.the compiler showed me an error saying that the public type class should be declared in its own file
the filename must have the same name as the public class name in the file,which is the way to tell the JVM that this is an entry point.
